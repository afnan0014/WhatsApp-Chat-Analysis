- Upload and parse WhatsApp chat files (.txt format)
- Display total messages, words, links, and media shared
- Analyze user activity levels and identify top contributors
- Visualize monthly and daily timelines of messaging
- Generate heatmaps showing active days and periods
- Create word clouds from frequent words
- Analyze emoji usage patterns
- Focus on individual users or the overall group

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Streamlit (for building the web app)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- WordCloud (for generating word clouds)
- urlextract (for extracting URLs)
- emoji (for analyzing emojis)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
3. Run the Streamlit app:
4. Open the app in your browser, upload a WhatsApp chat file, and start analyzing!

## Dataset
